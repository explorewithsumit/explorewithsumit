## ðŸ“š About

LeetCode provides a great collection of SQL problems, and this repository takes it a step further by solving them using **PySpark**, a distributed data processing framework commonly used in big data environments like **Databricks**.

This is especially useful for:

- Data Engineers preparing for interviews
- Practicing PySpark transformations
- Understanding SQL-to-Spark translation
- Hands-on with Window Functions, Joins, Aggregations, and more

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **PySpark (Spark SQL, DataFrame API)**
- **Python 3**
- Optional environment: **Databricks**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, or **VSCode**
