# PII and Data Masking Techniques

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) refers to any data that can be used to identify an individual. In the context of data engineering, PII is a critical aspect to consider when dealing with sensitive data. Masking techniques are employed to protect PII and prevent unauthorized access. This article discusses PII and data masking techniques, including an example of how they can be applied.

Types of PII

PII can take different forms. Common examples of PII include:

- Full names and aliases
- Email and mailing addresses
- Phone numbers
- Social security numbers and national identification numbers
- Driver's license and passport numbers
- Dates of birth and ages
- Healthcare information such as medical records, diagnosis, and treatment history
- Financial data such as bank account numbers and credit card information

Data Masking Techniques

Data masking is a process of replacing sensitive data with realistic, but not actual values, to prevent unauthorized access to PII. The following are common data masking techniques:

1. Substitution:

Substitution involves replacing sensitive data with alternate values that mimic the original data. For instance, a Social Security number (SSN) can be replaced with a random SSN that has the same format and distribution.

Example:

Consider a dataset containing customer information, including their SSN. To protect PII, the SSN can be replaced with a random SSN generated using a formula, such as:

- First three digits: 100-200
- Next two digits: Random number between 01 and 36
- Last four digits: Random numbers between 0001 and 9999

2. Subsetting:

Subsetting involves selecting a subset of the sensitive data to be masked. The process ensures that sensitive data is masked while still preserving the desired statistical properties of the data.

Example:

Consider a dataset with customer transactions. To protect PII, a portion of the data can be masked, such as:

- The last four digits of a credit card number
- The monthly income of customers

3. Pseudonymization:

Pseudonymization involves replacing PII with a unique identifier that is not directly linked to the original data. The unique identifier is linked to the original data through a lookup table that is maintained separately.

Example:

Consider a dataset containing customer information, including their names and addresses. To protect PII, a unique identifier can be assigned to each customer, such as:

- A customer ID generated using a formula based on their full name and address
- The customer ID is linked to the original data through a lookup table that is maintained separately

Benefits and Drawbacks of Data Masking

Data masking techniques provide numerous benefits, such as:

1. Protection of sensitive data:

Data masking techniques ensure that sensitive data is protected and prevents unauthorized access to PII.

2. Preservation of statistical properties:

Subsetting ensures that sensitive data is masked while still preserving the desired statistical properties of the data.

3. Enhancing data security:
