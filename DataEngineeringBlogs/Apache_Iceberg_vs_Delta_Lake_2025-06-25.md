Apache Iceberg vs Delta Lake: Choosing the Right Data Lake Storage Format for Your Data Warehouse

In recent years, the popularity of cloud-based data warehousing solutions has increased significantly. As a result, there has been a growing demand for optimized data lake storage formats that can be easily integrated with popular data warehousing tools. Two such formats that have gained attention in recent times are Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake, both of which are designed to provide efficient and scalable data storage for data warehousing use cases.

In this article, we will compare and contrast Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake, two popular data lake storage formats, and discuss the key factors that should be considered when choosing the right format for your data warehouse.

Apache Iceberg:

Apache Iceberg is a new open-source data storage format that enables efficient and scalable data lake analytics. It is designed to work with existing data processing frameworks such as Spark, Flink, and Presto, making it an ideal choice for data warehousing use cases. Iceberg provides a layer of abstraction over traditional data lake storage formats like Parquet and ORC, and enables efficient data querying and manipulation by optimizing data organization and access patterns.

Key features of Apache Iceberg:

1. Schema Evolution: Iceberg enables schema evolution, which means that the table definition can be changed without impacting existing data or queries. This is achieved by storing the table definition separately from the data itself, and allowing for incremental schema updates.

2. Incremental Data Loading: Iceberg supports incremental data loading, which means that only the changed data is loaded into the table, leading to significant time and resource savings.

3. Multi-Format Support: Iceberg supports multiple file formats including Parquet, ORC, and Avro, providing flexibility in terms of storage and query optimization.

4. Data Access and Query Optimization: Iceberg provides efficient data access and query optimization by organizing data into partitions and indexes, and using a special metadata store to manage table data and schema.

Delta Lake:

Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that is designed to provide a fault-tolerant, schema-enforced data lake. It is built on top of Apache Spark and Apache Parquet, and provides a transactional data integration and management layer on top of existing data lake storage. Delta Lake enables efficient and scalable data processing, and supports features like schema evolution, incremental data loading, and time travel.

Key features of Delta Lake:

1. ACID Transactions: Delta Lake provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions for data processing, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

2. Schema Evolution: Delta Lake supports schema evolution, allowing for table definitions to be changed without impacting existing data or queries.

3. Time Travel: Delta Lake provides time travel functionality, allowing for querying historical versions of the data and enabling data rollback.

4. Data Access and Query Optimization: Delta Lake uses Parquet to provide efficient data storage and query optimization, and also supports optimized data access patterns for data warehousing use cases.
