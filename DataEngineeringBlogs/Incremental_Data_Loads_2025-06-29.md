# Incremental Data Loads

in Data Engineering

Incremental Data Loads:

1. Overview:
- Definition of incremental data loads
- The benefits of incremental data loads
- The drawbacks of incremental data loads

2. Use Cases:
- ETL process optimization
- Real-time data delivery
- Data freshness management

3. Implementation:
- Data comparison methods: Full table scan, Key-Based Change Data Capture (CDC), Log-Based CDC, and Trigger-Based CDC
- Data load frequency: Batch, Micro-batch, and Streaming
- Data load process: Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT)

Example:

Consider a Sales Application with a Sales table containing the following columns: Order_ID (Primary Key), Product_ID, Quantity, Price, and Customer_ID. The application is used by many customers, and new sales data is added frequently to the Sales table.

To optimize the ETL process and improve data freshness, incremental data loads are implemented using Key-Based CDC. The Sales Application logs all changes to the Sales table, including updates, deletes, and inserts, with the new Sales_ID and a timestamp.

During the ETL process, the incremental data loader extracts the Sales_ID and timestamp for the Sales table from the last load, compares it with the current Sales_ID and timestamp, and loads only the new or changed rows. This process is repeated periodically, and the data is loaded into a Data Warehouse or a Data Lake.

The benefits of incremental data loads in this use case are:

- Reduced ETL time and cost due to loading only new or changed data
- Improved data freshness, as the Data Warehouse or Data Lake contains updated data more frequently
- Reduced resource usage, as the ETL process is less resource-intensive due to loading fewer rows

The drawbacks of incremental data loads in this use case are:

- Increased complexity due to implementing CDC in the Sales Application
- Increased ETL process latency, as the data loader compares large amounts of data each time
- Increased risk of data inconsistency, as the Data Warehouse or Data Lake may not contain all historical data due to loading only new or changed rows.

Incremental data loads can also be implemented using other methods, such as Full table scan, Log-Based CDC, or Trigger-Based CDC, depending on the specific use case and data source. It is also essential to choose the appropriate data load frequency, Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT), and data comparison method for optimal performance and data freshness.

In summary, incremental data loads significantly improve the ETL process, data freshness, and resource usage in Data Engineering, while also presenting some challenges that must be carefully considered and addressed.
